## Description



## Deployed Application

This challenge does not include a deployed application. Instead, a screen-recorded video is submitted alongside the github repo link.

## Future Improvements

 * Inquirer .prompt questions cleaner and DRYer
 * Ability to add more than one of each employee type (ask each time if we want to add another manager, engineer, intern, or none)

## Installation

To operate this app, follow these instructions:

1] Fork this repository to create a copy in your own Github
2] Clone it down to your computer with either the SSH key (if you have that set up, or the HTTPS link)
3] Open your computer's version of the terminal (GitBash, iTerm, etc.)
4] Within the terminal, navigate (cd) into the new local repo you have just created
5] Enter "npm install" or "npm i" in the terminal to install the necessary node modules for this project
6] Enter "node index.js" to run the app.
7] The app should ask you a series of questions about your workplace team members, then create an HTML for you to display to everyone!
